<!-- I am computational scientist focusing on the development and application of novel computational techniques in data-intensive research fields, in particular functional genomics and microbial ecology of the human body and [http://sorvi.r-forge.r-project.org open government data in Finland]. 
Computational analysis of human microbial ecology forms the current main focus of my research activity at [http://www.mib.wur.nl/UK/ Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University], Netherlands. Before that, I was employed at [http://www.vetmed.helsinki.fi/apalva/index.htm Centre of Excellence in Microbial Food Safety Research], Department of Veterinary Bioscience, University of Helsinki, Finland, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/research Adaptive Informatics Research Centre of Excellence], Aalto University, [http://www.helsinki.fi/cmg/english/group/research_group.html Laboratory of Cytomolecular Genetics], University of Helsinki and as a visiting researcher at [http://www.ebi.ac.uk European Bioinformatics Institute EBI], Hinxton, UK, developing machine learning approaches for genome- and organism-wide analysis of the human transcriptome, cancer genomics, and cross-species studies.
