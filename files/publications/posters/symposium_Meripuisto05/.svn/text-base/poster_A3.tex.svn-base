  {\Large \textbf{Introduction}}      
  {\large 

Functions of human genes are often studied indirectly, by model
organisms such as the mouse. An underlying assumption is that genes
with a common evolutionary origin i.e. orthologous genes, have similar
functional roles in both species.

It is critical to know whether the function of orthologues is really
similar. Orthologous gene groups with unexpectedly many similarly
expressed gene pairs may highlight important physiological
similarities between the species. Diverged gene function may refer to
significant evolutionary changes.

Here a dependency exploration tool called associative clustering (AC)
[2] is used to identify orthologous man-mouse gene pairs with
potentially interesting regularity in their expression (Fig.~1).

\vspace{1ex} \scriptsize{Principle of AC. Two sets of gene expression
profiles are clustered simultaneously, and the results are represented
on a contingency table where clusters of the two data sets correspond
to the rows and columns of the table, respectively, and are called the
{\it margin clusters}. Table cells, i.e. {\it cross clusters} contain
orthologous gene pairs of the two data sets. Cluster centroids are
optimized to produce a maximally dependent table, in the sense of the
Bayes factor of dependent vs. independent margins. Potentially
interesting co-occurrences are revealed by cross clusters with
significant deviation from the hypothesis of independent
margins. Reliability of the results is enhanced by bootstrap
i.e. repeating the clustering with slightly differing samples;
frequent co-occurrences are selected for further analyses from a
co-occurrence tree with a specified threshold.}

  {\Large \textbf{Methods}}
  {\large

\begin{itemize}

\item AC explores dependencies in paired continuous-valued
multivariate data, clustering two sets of samples simultaneously. The
results are represented as easily interpretable clusters.

\item Cluster centroids are optimized to produce a maximally dependent
contingency table. Significantly deviating cross clusters reveal
potentially interesting orthologues (see Fig.~1).

\item Reliability of the results is enhanced by bootstrap (repeating
the clustering with slightly differing samples) and inspecting
repeated co-occurrences by hierarchical clustering [1].

cross cluster size from the hypothesis of independent
margins. Exceptionally small cross clusters are blue whereas
exceptionally large cross cluster are yellow. The table is ordered

{\Large \textbf{Experiments}}      
{\large 

\begin{itemize}
  
\item 2818 paired expression profiles from man-mouse orthologues were
available [3] with 46 and 45 human and mouse tissues,
respectively. The first 21 tissues were common for the two species.

\item AC was performed with 15 margin clusters for both expression
data sets, resulting in a \(15 \times 15\) contingency table with 12
samples per cluster on average (Fig.~2).

\item AC was bootstrapped 100 times. Hierarchical clustering reveals
frequent orthologue co-occurrences (Fig.~3).

data.}

{\Large \textbf{Results and conclusions}} {\large \begin{itemize}

\item AC produced significantly more dependent clusters than standard
K-means. The advantage of AC in comparison with other dependency
modeling algorithms, e.g. information bottleneck (IB) [4] is its
ability to produce more easily interpretable localized clusters
(Fig.~4). A generalization of IB for clustering continuous-valued data
is used for comparisons [2].

\item Ribosomal GO categories were enriched among the most frequently
co-occurring orthologues in large cross clusters, hinting at
exceptional level of conservation of such genes. In small cross
clusters, secretion and signal transduction categories were common,
suggesting differentiation between the species.

\item Two examples from large and small cross clusters of AC highlight
individual orthologues contributing significantly to data dependencies
(Fig.~5).
