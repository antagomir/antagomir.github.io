Data
===============================

Significant contributions to the public release and/or maintenance of
the following open data sets:

[Scientific journal subscription costs in Finland 2010-2015; MoE/ATT](http://openscience.fi/-/transparency-and-openness-to-scientific-publishing-the-finnish-research-organisations-pay-millions-of-euros-annually-to-the-large-publishers). The data set was released by Finnish Ministry of Education (Open Science and Research Initiative) following my Freedom of Information Request ([summary](http://ropengov.github.io/r/2016/06/10/FOI/)). Finland is now the first country to systematically collect and release this information.
