Research topics
---------------

I develop computational techniques to solve data-rich applications in
human microbial ecology, functional genomics, and digital humanities.
There is a great demand for targeted computational tools to extract
information from poorly characterized data collections with minimal human
intervention. By combining information across multiple, complementary
measurement sources it is possible to overcome some of the limitations
and statistical uncertainties associated with individual data
sets. Open source implementations turn the new models into accessible
tools that can guide further modeling and experimentation.


**Human microbiomics**  
Human gut microbiota constitutes one of the
most densely populated ecosystem on our planet. The known pan-genome
carries 500-fold more unique genes than our own genome, it is highly
dynamic in space and time, and a key contributor to immune system,
digestion of food, and various health complications. Characterizing
the overall structure, variability, and health associations of this
virtual metabolic organ forms a major challenge for contemporary human
biology. <!--In [Department of Veterinary Bioscience, University of
Helsinki](http://www.vetmed.helsinki.fi/english/vetbio/index.html) and
[Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen
University](http://www.mib.wur.nl/UK/), we work to understand the
dynamics of the human gut ecosystem based on high-throughput microbial
profiling data {[Poster at ISMB](http://posters.f1000.com/P1886)}.-->


**Functional genomics**   
Mapping of the three billion base-pair human
genome sequence in 2001 was the first step towards uncovering the
dynamic and contextual functional properties of the
genome. Understanding functional organization of genetic information
and its regulation through transcriptional, epigenetic, and other
mechanisms remains a key challenge for human biology. <!--In the thesis
work, I developed open source machine learning algorithms for data
integration in functional genomics.  For more details, check the [list
of publications](/work/pubs) and the [PhD
thesis](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2010/isbn9789526033686).-->


**Digital humanities and computational social science**   
I develop reproducible research tools for high-impact applications in digital humanities. Open data and open source have a central role in this research. During 2016-2019 we are specifically studying _Computational History and the Transformation of Public Discourse in Finland 1640–1910_, funded by Academy of Finland. See the [code page](/code/) for more info.
